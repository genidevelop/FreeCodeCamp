      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, pour in 600ml of water and add 30g of salt. Mix this well using your hand to help dissolve
          the salt.</li>
        <li>Add 100g (10% flour) to the water and mix it well with your hands until the flour dissolves.</li>
        <li>Next, add the yeast to the mix helping it to quickly melt in the water using your fingers and mix well with
          your hand.</li>
        <li>Now, add the rest of Flour using one hand, a small amount at a time, and mix with your other hand as you go.
        </li>
        <li>Once the dough has started to come together, flip it out on to a bench and start to knead it with both
          hands.</li>
        <li>Keep working the dough until you find it has come together and has a smooth consistency. Press down on the
          dough ball with one finger and if it bounces back, then it’s ready</li>
        <li>Place the pizza dough aside to rest on a flat surface, covering it with a damp cloth so it doesn’t dry out.
          Leave it to rest for at least 2 hours.</li>
        <li>After 2 hours, divide the dough into 4 equally balls (about 250g each).</li>
        <li>Roll each ball in a circular motion over and again in the one spot, using the palm of your hand until you
          have a smooth surface, round ball.</li>
        <li>Once you have made the Neapolitan pizza dough balls, place them in a flat surface. Leave this in an ambient
          location for 24 hours.</li>
        <li>After 24 hours your dough balls should have risen and are ready to use. Sprinkle flour on to the bench,
          placing the dough on top and starting 1cm from the bottom and working your way 1cm from the top, press down
          using your fingers. Then stop, turn it over and repeat until you have a small round base.</li>
        <li>Gently stretch this by picking up the dough and slightly stretching it onto one forearm then flipping it
          onto the bench. Repeat this before shaping it into a circle and then resting it on your bench.</li>



        <li>Start by spreading Italian tomato sauce on to your base using the back of a spoon in a circular motion.</li>
        <li>Add fresh basil leaves, a sprinkle of dry oregano, a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and thinly sliced
          cherry tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Break up a large mozzarella using your hands.</li>
        <li>Place the pizza in the oven at the MAX temperature to cook. Turn the pizza and cook it even on both sides.
        </li>
        <li>Once cooked, slice the pizza.
        </li>
        <li>And Voilà!...Enjoy!</li>
